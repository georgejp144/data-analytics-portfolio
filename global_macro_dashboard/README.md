üíπ Global Macro Dashboard ‚Äî Multi-Asset Economic Data Visualizer (R Shiny)

This project builds an interactive macroeconomic dashboard in R Shiny that visualises cross-asset relationships across global markets, monetary policy, and economic indicators.
It integrates data from FRED, Yahoo Finance, and Quandl into a unified macro dataset, transforming it into a dynamic analytics interface for macro-financial insights.

üéØ Objective

Deliver a real-time, multi-asset visualisation system that enables users to:

Monitor macro trends such as yield-curve shifts, credit spreads, and equity-bond correlations.

Compare and scale variables (e.g. GDP Growth vs VIX vs 10-Year Yields).

Analyse the monetary-policy transmission chain across FX, bonds, and commodities.

Identify periods of market stress, policy tightening, or volatility compression.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Data Collection ‚Äî Macro_Data_Collector.R

Builds a comprehensive daily macroeconomic dataset (Daily.csv) by connecting to FRED and Yahoo Finance APIs.

Data Category	Examples	Source
Macroeconomic	GDP (Global, US, China, Japan, Germany, UK, India), CPI, PCE, Unemployment, M1‚ÄìM3	FRED
Equity Indices	S&P 500, NASDAQ, FTSE 100, DAX, Nikkei 225, Hang Seng, CAC 40	Yahoo Finance
FX Rates	EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, AUD/USD, USD/CAD, NZD/USD	Yahoo Finance / FRED
Commodities	WTI, Brent, Gold, Silver, Copper	Yahoo Finance
Interest Rates & Yields	Fed Funds, Discount, Prime, IORB, ON RRP, SOFR, 1M‚Äì30Y Treasuries	FRED
Credit Spreads	ICE BofA AAA, BBB, HY, EM Corporate, EM High Yield	FRED
Inflation Metrics	Median CPI, Sticky CPI, PCE, 5Y & 10Y Breakevens	FRED
Volatility Index	VIX CLS	FRED
Real Estate	Shiller Home Price Index, BIS Residential & Commercial Property Prices	FRED / BIS

Processing Steps:

Merges all datasets into a single daily-frequency table.

Forward-fills lower-frequency (monthly/quarterly) data using dplyr::fill().

Converts all series to numeric format and exports to:

C:/Users/pears/OneDrive/Desktop/MACRO/Daily.csv

2. Data Transformation ‚Äî Macro_Dashboard.R

Imports the compiled dataset and prepares it for interactive visualisation.

Parses and converts date fields.

Automatically determines earliest and latest available dates.

Computes z-scores for standardised comparison across variables:

z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)


Scales yield-curve data and builds long-format structures for plotting.

Generates a variable list dynamically for user-selectable charts.
