1. Install Python

You need Python 3.9 or higher.
Download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Required Python Packages

Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


This installs all the libraries needed (NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Alpaca API, TA indicators, etc.).

3. Add Your Alpaca API Keys

The script requires Alpaca Data API keys for historical price data.

In the project folder, create a file called .env

Add the following lines:

ALPACA_API_KEY_ID=your_key_here
ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_here


Save the file.
The code will load these automatically.

4. Create the symbols.csv File

This file tells the batch runner which tickers to process.

Create a file named symbols.csv in the root folder, and add one ticker per line. Example:

symbol
QQQ
AAPL
MSFT
NVDA


Do not include spaces or extra formatting.


5. Run the Pipeline

The script will:

Load API keys

Read symbols.csv

Download 7 years of data

Build the feature set

Compute ATM IV (14-DTE)

Train LSTM

Train XGBoost

Run walk-forward validation

Compute regime similarity

Compute drift score

Build ensemble forecast

Generate volatility signals

Export all output files

This process may take several minutes depending on your hardware and number of tickers.

6. Outputs Are Saved Automatically

After running, you will find all results in:

batch_vol_runs/


This folder is auto-created if it does not exist.

You will see:

feature_set_<TICKER>.csv

feature_health_<TICKER>.csv

wfa_xgb_<TICKER>.csv

vol_dashboard_data_<TICKER>.csv

summary_metrics.csv

These files include forecasts, IV–RV edge, compression metrics, model weights, confidence scores, drift scores, and all signals.
